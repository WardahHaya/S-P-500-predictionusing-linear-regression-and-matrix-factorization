## Project Overview 🚀
Exploring the fascinating realm of linear regression and matrix factorization applied to S&P 500 data, with the goal of deciphering stock market trends and uncovering potential investment opportunities.

## Data 📊
Utilizing historical data from the S&P 500 index and individual stock constituents, featuring key parameters such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, volume, and dividend yield.

## Methodology 📑
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🛠️
- Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the S&P 500 dataset.
- Feature engineering: crafting new features to enhance predictive capabilities.

### Linear Regression 📈
- Constructing a robust linear regression model to predict stock closing prices based on various features.
- Model performance evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and mean-squared error.

### Matrix Factorization 🔍
- Application of matrix factorization techniques like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to unveil hidden patterns and relationships within the stock data.
- In-depth analysis of identified factors and their interpretation in the context of the dynamic stock market.

## Software Tools 🛠️
- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Visualization tools: Matplotlib
